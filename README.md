<td>
   Simple weather application. The main reason for building it was to practice more with react+redux ecosystem.
</tr>
</table>

## Demo
Here is a working live demo : http://react-redux-weatherapp.herokuapp.com/

## Built with

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Redux](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) - a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
- and a ton of other cool frontend dev tools.
